# 🐍 Python MasterClass

Welcome to the **Python MasterClass** repository! This series is designed to help interns and learners build a solid foundation in Python and progress into the world of **Data Science**, using Python as a primary tool for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation.

---

## 📘 Description

Python is a free, general-purpose, and portable programming language known for its **simple syntax**, **readability**, and **extensibility**. Its vast ecosystem and strong community support make it one of the top choices for modern developers and data scientists.

The course primarily focuses on **Data Science**, which unifies statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and related methods to understand and analyse real-world phenomena using large datasets. Python, along with libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**, has become essential for data scientists due to its powerful data manipulation capabilities.

This course introduces:
- Fundamental concepts of the Python language.
- Practical applications in data science.
- Key libraries used in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and basic Machine Learning.

## 🎯 Objectives

This series is split into two learning tracks:

### 🔰 1. Introduction to Python
For learners who are new to Python but familiar with basic programming.

You will learn:
- Python syntax, variables, and types  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets  
- Functions and modules  
- File I/O operations  
- Writing scripts and creating packages  

📌 **Outcome**: Ability to write basic Python applications using functions and modules.

---

### 📊 2. Python for Data Science  
For learners with Python experience who want to apply it in Data Science.

You will learn:
- Working with NumPy arrays  
- Visualising data with Matplotlib  
- Data manipulation using Pandas  
- Handling time series data  
- Web scraping basics  

📌 **Outcome**: Ability to perform data wrangling, statistical analysis, access remote resources, and create visualisations.
